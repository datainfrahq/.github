We are building next-generation, cloud-native infrastructure to power self-service data analytics platforms. With our products, organizations can build an internal open-source data cloud that keeps data within their network. Our mission is to enable seamless analytical data processing on Kubernetes with zero friction. Regardless of your preferred tooling - whether it's Druid or Pinot, Trino or Presto - we ensure that distributed data applications run smoothly on Kubernetes. Let us take care of the infrastructure while you focus on driving insights from your data.
